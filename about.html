                    <p>Black ring: <br> A black ring worn on the middle finger is a symbol of the asexual community while one worn on the ring finger is a symbol of the aromantic community.</p>
                    <p><br>Lavender: <br> Lavender is a color and flower often assoicated with the queer community. Lavender was worn at some early protests for queer rights and has since become a symbol of queer resistance.</p>
                    <p><br>Green Caration: <br> The green carnation was worn on the lapel in the late 1800s to signal that a person identified as queer.</p>
                    <p><br>Butterfly: <br> Butterflies are often associated with the trans community because of the transformation they undergo. </p>
