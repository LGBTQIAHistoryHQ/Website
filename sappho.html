        <h1>Sappho</h1>
        <p>Sappho was born to an aristocratic family in Lesbos in 630 B.C.E.. Eventually she became a widely known poet, even being regarded as the female version of Homer. Eventually she opened a school where she taught. <br> Unfortunately only a small percentage of her work survives today. It is estimated that she wrote around 12,000 lines of poetry; only 700 survive today. With only one complete poem, “Ode to Aphrodite”. The lines that do survive are mostly love poems, addressed to women. One example is a long fragment where she describes her distress at a woman leaving her.<br>Honestly, I wish I were dead.<br>Weeping many tears, she left me and said,<br>'Alas, how terribly we suffer, Sappho.<br>I really leave you against my will.'<br><br>And I answered: 'Farewell, go and remember me.<br>You know how we cared for you.<br><br>If not, I would remind you<br>...of our wonderful times.<br>For by my side you put on<br>many wreaths of roses<br>and garlands of flowers<br>around your soft neck.<br><br>And with precious and royal perfume<br>you anointed yourself.<br><br>On soft beds you satisfied your passion.<br><br>And there was no dance,<br>o holy place<br>from which we were absent.'<br><br>She also wrote poems addressed to men. There is a fragment from her teenage years:<br>Sweet mother, I cannot weave,<br>I slender Aphrodite has overwhelmed <br>Me with longing for a boy.<br><br>During her life she was held in great esteem by some and ridiculed by others. Some praised her genius; Plato called her the tenth muse and Solon of Athens remarking that he only wished to learn a specific poem by Sappho before he died. But she was also called immoral. Ovid called her “licentious” (promiscuous), saying that she taught her audience how to love women, which the Christian church was not particularly fond of. <br> Then around 380 C.E. Gregory of Nazianzus, the bishop of Constantinople, ordered that Sappho’s writing be burned. When Christian fanatics partially destroyed the library of Alexandria more of her work was lost. In 1073 Pope Gregory VII ordered a public burning of her work. These combined with other efforts to destroy Sappho’s work explain why so little survives today. During the renaissance scholars began collecting the remnants of her work. <br>Sappho again began getting recognition in the 19th century by English and German scholars. However they had quite a different interpretation of Sappho’s work, viewing her as a moral, chaste woman, while completely denying her queerness. Today Sappho’s work is studied as poetry and held up as displaying the beauty of queer love. She has become an important symbol to the queer community, particularly for sapphic people, whose label stems from her name. The label lesbian also draws its roots back to Sappho based on the name of the island she lived on, Lesbos.</p>
