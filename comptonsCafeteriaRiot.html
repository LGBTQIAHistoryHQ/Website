            <h1>Compton's Cafeteria Riot</h1>

            <p>Stonewall is often regarded as the beginning of LGBTQIA+ resistance but three years earlier a group of trans women and drag queens stood up to police at Gene Compton’s Cafeteria, a diner located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco.</p>
            <p>Tenderloin was a hotbed of sex work, drugs, and gambling but also one of the only places where trans women and drag queens could live openly. Donna Personna was 17 when she took a bus to San Francisco eventually becoming a regular at Compton’s. She says, “It was like I’m home, in a way…I really felt like I was in wonderland. They took care of me like big sisters. They were just so sweet to me and to each other.” However, police still regularly harassed them and they were often arrested for “female impersonation”.</p>
            <p>Tarma Ching is a trans woman who has frequented Tenderloin since the 60s and has lived there since 1992 and she describes how From Compton's "you could walk to Woolworth's to buy [fake] eyelashes, and it was two blocks from the airline bus terminal," where many trans women and drag queens would go to change from men’s to women’s clothes. This made Compton’s a popular queer hangout to the management's displeasure. They would often call the police to clear the place out.</p>
            <p>Resistance began to spring up in 1966. A group of radical young queer people called Vanguard formed. It was the first known gay youth group and the first transgender group period. They began to push back against discrimination by police and business owners. They picketed outside Compton’s in July. </p>
            <p>One night in August the community's frustration at the constant harassment they faced boiled over when a policeman grabbed a drag queen inside Compton’s and she threw her coffee in his face. After that tables were flipped, salt shakers were thrown, and police were hit with purses. By the end of the night a cop car was flipped, a newsstand on fire, and dozens of people hauled off in policemen’s paddy wagons.</p>
            <p>Amanda St. Jaymes, a transgender woman who ran a residential hotel nearby, was present at the riot. She is quoted saying, "We just got tired of it. We got tired of being harassed. We got tired of being made to go into the men's room when we were dressed like women. We wanted our rights."</p>
            <p>The entire event was almost completely forgotten until Dr Susan Stryker, a transgender scholar, found a mention of “Drag queens protest police harassment at Compton’s Cafeteria” in the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society archives. There was practically no additional information. It took Stryker years to piece together what happened, as many records including arrest records had disappeared. Eventually she met St. Jaymes and began to find people who witnessed the event. She was able to piece together a record and released a documentary called Screaming Queens in 2005 about the event. Interviews from Ching, St. Jaymes, and many others are included in the documentary.</p>
            <p>Today, Tenderloin continues to be a gatherspace for trans people. Mahogany, who was previously a social worker in the area and is now working to advocate for the trans community in Tenderloin, says “There is such a huge presence of trans folks – there’s nowhere else in the city, and maybe the world, where you see so many trans folks concentrated in a small area.”</p>
            <p>This is partly due to the fact that Tenderloin is one of the few areas that has maintained affordable housing prices in the heart of San Francisco. Local organizers continue to fight genrefication and poor living conditions. A group of black trans women were able to secure funding to create community services and an official district that covers six blocks and is the first legally recognized trans district in the world. It is hoped that in time the district can be turned into a hub for trans people with community space, housing, job training and businesses “owned and operated by and for trans people”.</p>
            <p>Personna states that it is difficult for her to remember that the women who rioted at Compton’s never got to live in a society that respected them. Her message to them is “Ladies, you didn’t live in vain. Your life is serving a bigger purpose now … And your story is never going to die.”</p>
