            <h1>Floral Symbolism</h1>

            <h2>Violets:</h2>
            <p>Violet’s association with the queer community draws its roots back to Sappho. In her poetry, she often referenced nature and flowers. Specifically, she mentioned violets many times.</p>
            <p><i>Many crowns of violets,<br>roses and crocuses<br>…together you set before more<br>and many scented wreaths<br>made from blossoms<br>around your soft throat…<br>…with pure, sweet oil<br>…you anointed me,<br>and on a soft, gentle bed…<br>you quenched your desire…<br>…no holy site…<br>we left uncovered,<br>no grove…</i></p>
            <p>This symbolism continued. In the 1926 play The Captive one woman sends violets to another. This led to a boycott of the play and calls for it to be censored. Production was shut down by the New York City district attorney’s office in 1927 and this association between violets and lesbianism significantly cut violet sales in the US. However, when the play was showing in Paris some women wore violets to show their support.</p>
            <p>Violets became further entwined with queer history when seven gay writers of the 1980s called themselves “The Violet Quill”. Christopher Cox, Robert Ferro, Michael Grumley, Andrew Holleran, Felice Picano, Edmund White, and George Whitmore regularly met in New York City to read and critique each other’s work.</p>

            <h2>Pansies:</h2>
            <p>Pansy was an early twentieth-century term for flamboyant gay men. In the 20s and 30s, many cities went through “pansy crazes”. During this time, especially in Harlem, extravagant drag balls were popular, drawing crowds as large as 7,000. In Berlin, singers were performing Das Lila Lied (The Lavender Song) which celebrated queerness. </p>
            <p>These beginnings of queer nightlife flourished in New York as legitimate bars closed and mob-controlled speakeasies sprung up due to prohibition. That was until the city's police commissioner stationed an officer outside of every known pansy club and barred “female impersonators” from entering. With this crackdown, many queer people fled to cities in other countries, including Berlin and Paris, where they could find freedom unavailable in the US.</p>
            <p>There was also queer representation from Hollywood during the pansy craze which was unprecedented for the time. This was put to a stop by The Hays Code but they could not stop that queerness had been brought to the national consciousness.</p>

            <h2>Green Carnations:</h2>
            <p>The green carnation as an indicator of queerness draws its roots back to Oscar Wilde. In Victorian times assigning meanings to flowers was very common, and when creating press for his play Lady Windermere’s Fan Wilde asked people to wear green carnations on their lapels to the opening.</p>
            <p>When asked what it meant he said “Nothing whatsoever.” But within days of the opening green carnations were everywhere, worn mostly by gay men. So whatever Wilde’s intentions a green carnation wore on the lapel became a subtle indicator of queerness with all the necessary plausible deniability.</p>
            <p>In 1892 Wilde’s lover Lord Alfred Douglas wrote a poem called “Two Loves” filled with floral imagery:</p>
            <p>I dreamed I stood upon a little hill,<br>And at my feet there lay a ground, that seemed<br>Like a waste garden, flowering at its will<br>With buds and blossoms. There were pools that dreamed<br>Black and unruffled; there were white lilies<br>A few, and crocuses, and violets<br>Purple or pale, snake-like fritillaries<br>Scarce seen for the rank grass, and through green nets<br>Blue eyes of shy pervenche winked in the sun.<br>And there were curious flowers, before unknown,<br>Flowers that were stained with moonlight, or with shades<br>Of Nature’s wilful moods; and here a one<br>That had drunk in the transitory tone<br>Of one brief moment in a sunset; blades<br>Of grass that in an hundred springs had been<br>Slowly but exquisitely nurtured by the stars,<br>And watered with the scented dew long cupped<br>In lilies, that for rays of sun had seen<br>Only God’s glory, for never a sunrise mars<br>The luminous air of Heaven.</p>
            <p>After Wilde’s arrest the connotation of homosexuality remained with the flower, to the point it became nearly extinct.</p>

            <h2>Lavender:</h2>
            <p>Lavender has become a symbol of queer resistance. In the late 1800s, lavender began to be linked to the queer community as it was part of the Aesthetes movement which was denounced by many as “effeminate”. Oscar Wilde was one of the leaders of this movement.</p>
            <p>In the 30s gay men were taunted with the description of having a “streak” of lavender. The removal of queer men and women from government jobs under President Eisenhower’s order was dubbed the lavender scare.</p>
            <p>In 1969 the queer community began reclaiming lavender as a symbol of power. Lavender sashes and armbands were given to participants in a gay power march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn. In response to Betty Friedan’s attempts to keep the “Lavender Menace” out of the feminist movement activists began wearing shirts that said lavender menace to feminist events.</p>
