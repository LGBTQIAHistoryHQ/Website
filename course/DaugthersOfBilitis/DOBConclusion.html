            <p class="paragraphText">The Ladder written by the Daughters of Bilitis was the first nationally distributed lesbian publication based in the United States. The Daughters of Bilitis helped bring visibility and acceptance to the queer community by educating the public, including hetero and homosexuals. They also helped form a queer community by creating meeting spaces for queer people as an alternative to bars.</p>
