                <p class="paragraphText">Small group discussions for women interested in the problems encountered in raising children in a deviant relationship will be sponsored by the Daughters of Bilitis in the San Francisco Bay Area. Several professional leaders in the nursery school and parent-education field have offered to participate as discussion moderators and lend assistance based on their knowledge and experience.</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">Certainly all mothers and any other women interested in this subject should contact the Daughters of Bilitis, P. O. Box 2183, San Francisco 26, California. Discussions will be set up in the very near future.</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">For those out of town who have expressed interest, THE LADDER will print a series of articles based on these discussions.</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">Suggestions for other topics of discussion will be welcome.</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">On pages 3 and 4 of the December issue of THE LADDER, a serious mis-print occurred. Item 13 of the list of rules to follow in case of arrest should read as follows:</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">"If you are questioned by any law enforcement officer, including the FBI, remember that you are NOT required to answer any questions concerning yourself or others. (5th Amendment, U. S. Constitution.)"</p>
