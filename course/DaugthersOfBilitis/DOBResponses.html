                <p class="paragraphText">"It may be that I can be of additional assistance to the movement. I am devoting some time on journalism and I visit San Francisco on some occasions."</p>

                <p class="paragraphText">"I am very happy to be on your mailing list for THE LADDER.

                <p class="paragraphText">"If an L.A. chapter were to be formed in this area, what would be its main activities? I think your publication is a great thing, but I do wonder about these meetings you hold. It seems that those attending and listening to a discussion are the very ones who would least benefit from hearing what is said. Other than the social aspect of the group, I don't yet see the purpose."</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">D. B., Long Beach, Calif.</p>
                <p class="paragraphText">We have a number of interesting letters that space does not permit including in this issue. We hope to publish excerpts from them in future issues. The response has been most gratifying. Keep on writing!</p>
