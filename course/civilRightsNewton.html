                <p class="cardTextLarge">Think About: <br> 1. How does Newton characterize the rights of homosexuals? <br> 2. Why does Newton believe that fighting for the rights of homosexuals is important? <br> 3. According to Newton, how was the movement for LGBTQ rights part of the broader movement for Civil Rights?</p>

            <p class="paragraphText">During	the	past few years strong movements	have developed among women and among homosexuals seeking their liberation. There has been some uncertainty about how to relate to these movements.</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">Whatever your personal	opinions and your insecurities about homosexuality and the various liberation movements	among homosexuals and women	(and I speak of	the	homosexuals	and	women as oppressed groups), we should try to unite with	them in	a revolutionary	fashion…</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">We	must gain security in ourselves	and	therefore have respect and feelings	for	all	oppressed people. We must not use the racist attitude that the white racists use against our people	because	they are Black and poor. Many times the	poorest	white person is	the	most racist	because	he is afraid that he might lose	something, or discover something that he does not have.	So you’re some kind of a threat	to	him. This kind of psychology is	in operation when we view oppressed	people and we are angry	with them because of their particular kind of behavior, or their particular	kind of	deviation from the established norm.</p>
            <p class="paragraphText">Remember, we have not established a revolutionary value system; we	are	only in	the	process	of establishing	it.	I do not remember our ever constituting	any	value that said	that a revolutionary must say offensive	things towards homosexuals,	or that	a revolutionary	should make	sure that women	do not speak out about their own particular kind of	oppression.	As a matter	of fact, it	is just	the	opposite: we say that we recognize the women’s right to	be free. We	have not said much about the homosexual	at all, but	we must	relate to the homosexual movement because it is	a real thing. And I	know through reading, and through my life experience and observations that homosexuals are not given freedom and liberty by	anyone in the society. They	might be the most oppressed	people in the society.</p>
