                <p class="cardText">Think About It: Now that youâ€™ve learned about ACT UP/LA look back at the predictions you made at the beginning of the lesson. Were they accurate? How would you change your answers now?</p>

            <p class="text">During the AIDS epidemic ACT UP achieved remarkable results. They staged impactful protests that drew media attention and the way queer people were perceived began to change. The press began to report on how hard the queer community was fighting for their lives rather than how helpless (and to blame) they were. ACT UP demonstrates the power of organization for a specific cause.</p>
