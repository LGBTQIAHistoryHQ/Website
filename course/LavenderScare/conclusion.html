            <p class="cardText">Consider:<br>— What were the historical circumstances that led to the Lavender Scare?<br>— What evidence did the United States government provide for firing people based solely on their sexual orientation?<br>— Why were gay Americans targeted as a response to the fear of Communism? Are these the same reasons as those the United States Government provided for firing people at this time? Explain.<br>— In what ways might the Lavender Scare have racialized LGBTQ+ activists?</p>
            
            <p class="paragraphText">The Lavender Scare was a dark time for LGBTQIA+ Americans. They faced not only disapproval from society but also extreme discrimination in hiring, from the government and private companies. They were made into scapegoats to channel the nation’s fear during the Cold War.</p>
