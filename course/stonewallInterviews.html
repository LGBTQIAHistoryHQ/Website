            <p class="boldText">A 2010 project, American Experience Stonewall Uprising, created a documentary full of interviews with people who experienced Stonewall and its impact. The full documentary is accessible on YouTube and the raw interview footage on American Archive (https://americanarchive.org/special_collections/stonewall-uprising-interviews).</p>

            <p class="paragraphText">This is one of the interviews conducted for the project. In it Virginia Apuzzo discusses how Stonewall begun her journey from a convent to being a gay rights activist. She was not at Stonewall but felt the ripple effects of the riots very strongly. As you watch be sure to note why Stonewall was so important for the queer community.</p>
