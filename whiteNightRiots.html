            <h1>The White Night Riots</h1>

            <p>On May 21, 1979, residents of the Castro district in San Francisco took to the streets to protest Dan White’s lenient sentencing.</p>
            <p>Dan White was a member of the Board of Supervisors who often clashed with fellow Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man elected to a public office in the US. In November, 1978, White resigned his post but after he changed his mind and asked to be reinstated. Mayor George Moscone denied his request and Milk lobbied against his reinstatement. On the 27th of November White broke into City Hall through a basement window and killed both Milk and Moscone in their offices.</p>
            <p>6 months later he was tried by a mostly white, catholic, straight, jury. His defense argued that he was in a diminished mental and emotional state at the time of the murders, evidenced by him going from being health conscious to eating too much junk food. He was portrayed as a good person who wasn’t capable of murder. He was found guilty; of manslaughter, not murder. He was sentenced to just 7 years and 8 months of jail time.</p>
            <p>Moscone’s murder had changed the power balance within the police department. Under him gay rights marches had been held without police intervention or violence. The police chief at the time was Charles Gain. He’d been appointed by Moscone and was very unpopular with the rank and file police force. Gain had been an ally to the queer community, he’d ordered officers to stop arresting gay people for breaking minor laws such as blocking the sidewalk and made a statement saying “If I had a gay policeman who came out I would support him one hundred percent.” Soon after that statement was published graffiti began appearing in the police station that said “Gain is a fruit.” Some officers may even have conspired to murder him while he was off duty. The only reason Gain had been able to stay in office was Moscone, who’d appointed him, had won the practically unanimous support of the San Francisco gay community, estimated to be around 150,000 people, and was not about to anger his supporters by removing Gain.</p>
            <p>But after Moscone’s murder Gain became a lame duck. He began to lose control of his officers and reports of police violence against the gay community began to reappear. And police raided a lesbian bar called Peg’s Place. Ten officers, some on duty, some not, ran into the bar, shouted slurs, and beat patrons and the owners with their night sticks.</p>
            <p>The community's anger was only building. Nine days before the riots began a gay man was outside a gay bar in the Castro, hanging up posters. A policeman came up to him, told him the posters violated a city ordinance and handcuffed him. Gay men poured out from the surrounding bars and shops. They surrounded the police officer and taunted him. He called for backup and soon half a dozen police cars were present but the mob had grown to 3,000. They were throwing things at the police and chanting “Dan White was a cop”. When the paddy wagon arrived people slashed its tires and the police quickly left.</p>
            <p>When the verdict broke, Cleve Jones, a close friend of Milk’s, spoke to a crowd of 500 and organized what was supposed to be a peaceful march. By the time they were marching to City Hall there were an estimated 5,000 protesters, and their anger had reached a boiling point. Police arrived to try and calm the situation but made it worse. But the police department had raised over $100,000 for White’s defense because he’d previously been a police officer. On the day of his arrest many officers even went up to him and nodded or patted him on the back. Many people believed that the police had conspired to reduce White’s charges and sentence.</p>
            <p>The protesters lacked the organization and leadership to maintain peace. Previously Harvey Milk had taken leadership in many marches for gay rights that had the potential to turn into riots but without him people were furious. Someone spoke into a saying “‘We are not Dan White! No violence tonight!’ and the crowd's response was ‘Bullshit!’ And peace broke.</p>
            <p>That night Gain lost complete control of his officers. The police had been ordered to simply hold the crowd back but many began to attack protesters with night sticks, even taping over their badges so they couldn’t be identified. The crowd fought back. Dozens of police cars and even part of City Hall were destroyed. After three hours the crowd was dispersed with tear gas. 59 officers and 124 protesters were injured and about two dozen arrests were made.</p>
            <p>A few hours later police officers gathered on their own to raid the Castro neighborhood. They vandalized a bar, assaulting its patrons while shouting homophobic slurs. Eventually they began attacking anyone who was out on Castro Street. Again the crowd fought back with one man yelling “We lost the battle at city hall. We aren’t going to lose this one.” It took two hours for the police chief to hear about officers and go to Castro to stop them. No one was ever reprimanded for the attacks, as officials couldn’t determine who had ordered them.</p>
            <p>The next day would have been Milk’s birthday. 20,000 people gathered to remember him. The rage of Milk’s murder and White’s lack of accountability didn’t fade. The next October the first March on Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights was held, and chants rang through the crowd, “Be gay, be proud, avenge Harvey Milk”.</p>
