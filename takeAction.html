                        <p>One of the most powerful things that you can do to spread knowledge about queer history is to learn about it yourself. By putting in the time and effort to learn about the parts of LGBTQIA+ history that interest you there is another person who knows them and you can speak with confidence to others.</p>

                        <p>Using the resources on this page you can learn about queer history. If our site doesn’t have the information you’re looking for you can do a good old fashioned google search and contact us to suggest the topic. You can also educate yourself on general queer rights issues in your area.</p>

                        <p>There are ways you can create a queer space in your community. If you’re in school you can suggest that the GSA has queer history themed meetings. If you’re not, you can look into your local park district and see if there’s a way to create a group focused on queer history. If it’s not safe for you to create in person queer events you look for and contribute to communities online.</p>
