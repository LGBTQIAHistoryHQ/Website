            <h1>The Soceity For Human Rights</h1>

            <p>Henry Gerber founded the organization desiring to create a more mainstream community focused gay scene in the US, similar to what he saw when he was a soldier stationed in Germany.</p>
            <p>The Society of Human Rights and received an official charter from the state of Illinois in 1924. Then the organization published the earliest-recorded homosexual periodical, Friendship and Freedom. </p>
            <p>The organization shut down in 1925 after Gerber and several members were arrested on obscenity charges. These arrests were conducted after a wife of one of the members tipped the police off.</p>
            <p>In 2015, the Henry Gerber House became the nation's second National Historic Landmark designated for its association with LGBTQ history.</p>
            <p>“[T]o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner inimical to the public welfare.” - The charter of the society of human rights</p>
