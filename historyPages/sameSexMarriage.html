            <h1>Same-Sex Marriage</h1>
            <p>Historical accounts of same-sex relationships can be difficult to interpret, very often the accounts are written by observers not by those involved in the relationships. This means there’s more information with other people’s assumptions about relationships than how the people in those relationships actually felt. There are questions of if these relationships should be categorized as gay or trans history given that they often involved a partner taking on social roles that deviated from the sex they were assigned at birth. But there’s no doubt that long before same-sex marriage was officially legalized queer people have been finding their own ways to share their lives as partners.</p>
            <p>Back in ancient Rome the marriage of two men was not uncommon. Roman marriage was defined as between a man and woman so marriage between two men only had meaning in private. Despite this many records of Roman homosexual marriage ceremonies have survived.</p>
            <p>For example there are three records of the emperor Nero marrying men. The first time was to a boy named Sporus:</p>
            <p><i>“[Nero] had a boy named Sporus castrated and tried to transform him into an actual woman; he married him in a regular wedding ceremony, with a dowry and a bridal veil, took him home in front of a great crowd, and treated him as his wife.” (Suetonius, Nero 28-29).</i></p>
            <p>The second was to Doryphorus and the third to Pythagoras. In the second two weddings Nero was “the woman” in the ceremony. These “marriages” were not necessarily relationships full of love but the telling of them as something unusual but not unheard of gives us insight into Roman society. It was not considered outlandish for a man to marry another man, but the idea of a man, especially an emperor, taking on a role normally assigned to a woman was.</p>
            <p>There are also records of marriages between people of the same sex in different Native American tribes. In these marriages one partner had often taken on a gender identity that did not match their sex. An example of this is the Spanish conquistador Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca wrote on his 1528-1536 journey across the Gulf Coast that he saw the custom of "one man married to another". In the marriages he observed one spouse occupied a gender role that settlers called the berdache, meaning a male person dressed as a woman and performed women’s work. Cabeza de Vaca used these marriages to build his argument that America needed the imposition of European order.</p>
            <p>In the 1800s a trader at Fort Astoria, Alexander Ross, encountered two strange Indians, in the character of man and wife," who were "in fact both women." His fellow trader David Thompson also wrote an account of the same couple. He had previously met the spouse that took the male role in women’s clothes and recognized them. He said she had "declared her sex changed, that she was now a Man, dressed and armed herself as such, and also took a young woman to Wife."</p>
            <p>There is also evidence of queer couples in marriage like unions without any recognition from the law or their communities. Across time and location people have found partners regardless of persecution. Queer, mixed-race, and enslaved couples have long proved that a relationship falling outside of societal rules does nothing to invalidate the emotions behind the relationship.</p>

            <br>

            <h2>Currently 36 countries have legalized gay marriage. How did we get here?</h2>
            <p>The right to marry someone of the same gender is a milestone civil right for queer people. It inherently acknowledges queer love as real. After the legalization of gay marriage LGBTQ+ people have reported feeling greater social acceptance and a sense of equality.</p>
            <p>Currently there are 36 countries that have legalized gay marriage they are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Uruguay.</p>
            <h4>The Netherlands</h4>
            <p>The Netherlands were the first country to legalize gay marriage in December of 2000. At that time the Dutch parliament passed by a 3-1 margin legislation giving same-sex couples the right to get married, get divorced, and adopt children.</p>
            <h4>Belgium</h4>
            <p>In 1998 same-sex couples in Belgium gained the right to file with a city clerk to officially assume joint responsibility of a household. But it wasn’t until January, 2003 that Belgium parliament fully legalized gay marriage.</p>
            <h4>Canada</h4>
            <p>Beginning in 1999 same-sex couples in Canada could become common law married, this provided most of the same legal benefits as marriage. In 2003 there were a series of court cases that brought about the legalization of gay marriage in 9 out of 13 of Canada’s provinces and territories. In 2005 the Canadian Parliament passed legislation legalizing it nationwide.</p>
            <h4>Spain</h4>
            <p>In 2005 the Spanish Parliament narrowly passed legislation to legalize gay marriage despite the strong opposition of Vatican officials. They modified the existing marriage statute to read, “Marriage will have the same requirements and results when the two people entering into the contract are of the same sex or of different sexes.”</p>
            <h4>South Africa</h4>
            <p>In November, 2006 the South African parliament legalized gay marriage with a greater than 5-1 margin. This decision came a year after the country’s highest court ruled that earlier laws prohibiting gay marriage violated the country’s constitutional guarantee of equal rights. The law allowed religious institutions and civil officers to refuse to carry out same-sex marriage ceremonies.</p>
            <h4>Norway</h4>
            <p>In 2008 a law was passed in Norway that gave gay couples the right to marry, adopt children and undergo artificial insemination. This replaced an earlier 1993 law permitting same sex civil unions.</p>
            <h4>Sweden</h4>
            <p>In April 2009, the Swedish parliament voted by a very large majority to legalize gay marriage. Same-sex couples had been allowed to register for civil unions since 1995.</p>
            <h4>Iceland</h4>
            <p>In June of 2010 the Icelandic legislature passed a measure legalizing gay marriage following board public support. It was another decade before the country allowed same-sex couples to adopt. When the law took effect the prime minister, Johanna Sigurdardottir and her longtime partner became one of the first to get married under the new statute.</p>
            <h4>Portugal</h4>
            <p>In early 2010 the Portuguese legislature passed a law to legalize gay marriage. The president, Anibal Cavaco Silva, then asked the Constitutional Court to review the law. The Court ruled that law is constitutionally valid and Silva signed the law in April, with it taking effect a month later. The law does not give same-sex couples the right to adopt.</p>
            <h4>Argentina</h4>
            <p>In July of 2010 Argentina became the first Latin American country to legalize gay marriage. Despite significant opposition from the Catholic and evangelical Protestant churches the measure passed both chambers of the legislature and was signed into law. It grants same-sex couples equal rights to heterosexual couples, including the right to adopt children.</p>
            <h4>Denmark</h4>
            <p>In June of 2012 Denmark’s legislature passed a bill legalizing gay marriage which took effect when Queen Margrethe II gave her assent a few weeks later. The law stated that the state church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, is required to allow same-sex couples to marry in their churches.</p>
            <p>Denmark had become the first country to allow same-sex couples to register for domestic partnership in 1989. And in 2010 began allowing same-sex couples who had registered for domestic partnership to adopt.</p>
            <h4>Uruguay</h4>
            <p>After passing the lower and upper chambers of the legislature President José Mujica signed a law legalizing gay marriage on May 3 2013. Uruguay began allowing civil unions in 2008 and same-sex adoption began in 2009.</p>
            <h4>New Zealand</h4>
            <p>In 2005 New Zealand began allowing same-sex civil unions. In 2013 a law legalizing gay marriage and same-sex adoption passed the legislature 77-44 and after being given royal assent by the country’s governor-general the law took effect in August.</p>
            <h4>France</h4>
            <p>French President Francois Hollande and his party campaigned with promises to legalize gay marriage in France. After being elected they upheld this promise and a bill to legalize same-sex marriage and adoption passed the legislature in April of 2013. The President was unable to sign the law until France’s highest court settled a dispute ruling the law constitutional on May 17th. The President signed the bill the next day.</p>
            <h4>Brazil</h4>
            <p>On May 14th, 2013, Brazil’s National Council of Justice ruled that same-sex couples should not be denied marriage licenses. This legalized gay marriage nationwide, previously about half of Brazil’s 27 jurisdictions had allowed gay marriage.</p>
            <h4>England and Wales</h4>

The same law also set the marriage age to 18 and eliminated a requirement that couples must take a medical exam before getting married.</p>
            <h4>Finland</h4>
            <p>As a result from a citizens initiative, a public petition with 167,000 signatures, the Finnish Parliment passed a bill legalizing same sex marriage in November of 2014. The president signed the bill into law in February 2015 and it went into effect in 2017.</p>
