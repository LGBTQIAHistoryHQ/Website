            <h1>The 1979 Marh on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights</h1>

            <p>There had been efforts to organize a national march for gay and lesbian rights for years before organizers were successful. In 1973 graduate students at the University of Illinois attempted it but couldn’t gather enough support. In 1978 Harvey Milk took a leading role in the organizing efforts. He was assassinated by a political rival only a few months later.</p>
            <p>Rage over Milk’s murder was a galvanizing force for the queer community, creating the unity and urgency necessary to pull off national organization. On October 14th, 1979, over 100,000 people joined the protest. During the march police estimated the number to be as high as 250,000. Their published five demands were to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pass a comprehensive gay/lesbian rights bill in Congress</li>
                <li>Issue a presidential executive order banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in the Federal Government, the military, and federally-contracted private employment</li>
                <li>Repel all anti-lesbian/gay laws</li>
                <li>End discrimination in lesbian mother and gay father custody cases</li>
                <li>Protect lesbian and gay youth from any laws which are used to discriminate against, oppress and/or harass them in their homes, schools, jobs, and social environments.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By 10 in the morning thousands had gathered at 4th Street and Madison Drive and the protesters set off for the lawns of the White House then to the Washington Monument. The organizing committee voted to have lesbians of color lead the march, followed by men of color. So a group called the Salsa Sisters led the march and carried the official banner.</p>
            <p>During the march chants of “We are everywhere, we will be free”, “We are gay, we couldn’t be prouder. You can’t hear us, we get a little louder.”, “Be gay, be proud, avenge Harvey Milk. Be lesbian, be proud, avenge Harvey Milk”, “One whole free people”, and “Out of the closet, into the street” rang through the crowds.</p>
            <p>Before the actual march speakers talked to the crowd. These speakers included Robin Tyler a lesbian comic and activist, Steve Ault who was on the march committee, Tom Robinson an activist and recording artist, Lucia Valeska who was a part of the National Gay Task Force, Allen Ginsberg a poet and teacher, Arlie Scott an activist, Richard Ashworth from Parents & Friends of Lesbians & Gays, Floryence Kennedy a consumer activist, Charles Law from Texas Southern University, Mary Watkins & Company from Oliva Recording Artists, and Kate Millett an author, filmmaker, and poet.</p>
            <p>“This is not a movement from the waist down. We are talking about our right to love, and to choose, and to live. And I don’t care about straight politics, and I don’t care about straight understanding. You better hear me in Washington, we are demanding our civil rights.” - Robin Tyler.</p>
            <p>“Congress and American people, how can you help yourself? We have come out here to help you to ease your grief stricken hearts. Fear of gays is claustrophobia, closed minds, violence, accusation, hypocrisy, tough hearts hiding panic. This day’s gay liberation can mean liberation of heterosexual dignity, social delight, city playfulness, country tolerance, national non aggression, international charm and spiritedness, enlighted masculine gentleness, feminine mutual affection, granny wisdom’s old fashioned opened mindedness, diversity of the physical body politic, ya self acceptance of body, humor of speech, spaciousness, friendliness, sensitivity, the dignity and wisdom of a whole blue sky of the mind we stand under.” -Steve Ault</p>
            <p>“Well, look at us. You know us America. We are some of your best friends. We’re some of your best relatives, your sisters, your brothers, your mothers, your fathers, your daughters, and your sons.” - Tom Robinson.</p>
            <p>“We parents want to persuade society that our gay children are not acting out of defiance or self indulgence. They are being true to their own nature. Our children are fine men and women. And we say to society that the parents and friends of lesbians and gay men will support their children.” - Richard Ashworth.</p>
            <p>Floryence Kennedy stated, “Look at us, 250,000 in the daylight, in Washington DC. No famines, no pestilence, no earthquakes, no floods. Oh, eat your heart out Anita Bryant.” Anita Bryant was a popular singer and anti gay activist of the time.</p>
            <p>Charles Law said, “I believe Harvey Milk went to the mountaintop of America. I believe that Harvey Milk had gone to the top of the mountain of discrimination. He had gone to the top of the mountain of oppression. He had gone to the top of the mountain of psychological and societal bereavement. And I believe Harvey Milk from the top of that mountain looked down on Wichita, looked down on Kansas City, looked down on Dave County, looked down on Oklahoma, looked down on Seattle, looked down on Texas, looked down on the Supreme Court and the Congress, and I believe that Harvey Milk saw gay people would one day be full, free, and equal citizens in this country. And it is our responsibility to come out of the wilderness, not to wander and meander and linger in the wilderness, in the wilderness of despair, but to come out and realize the dream, realize the promised land. And gather our strength, our fortitude, our creativity, our initiative, and our hope, and go into that promised land of dignity, of pride, and of respect.”</p>
            <p>Mary Watkins & Company finished playing a song then Watkins took the microphone and stated, “I wish I knew how it is to be free. I never thought that I would ever see anything like this. And I’m…I would cry if I were the type.”</p>
            <p>“Can I talk to you about love? That’s why we’re here, isn’t it? May I remind you that love is against the law. That love, as we know it, is a criminal activity. That lovemaking involves illegal acts. We are here because we have committed them and we enjoyed them enormously. We are an army of lovers. That is a fearful thing. We are the only minority group, also, that you can join overnight. [cheering and laughing] In the twinkling of an eye in fact. We who have committed the crime of loving, we are freedom with more risks than servitude ever offered. We dare to know pleasure. May I say pleasure again, I don’t think it's been mentioned much today. We had guts enough to love. They tried to cover this with guilt, shame, dishonor. They made it as awful for us as they could, but it was wonderful, it is getting more wonderful. Fellow criminals, never forget your nights in the days of your fighting for their freedom. Remember this experience, it is the tenderest, finest, moment of our lives. And in the clamor for our civil rights always remember that they never granted them nor withdrew them, they only stole them. And remember most of all that we have so much more to give them then they have ever taken from us. We have been places. We have known things, seen suffering, feared, felt, experienced ecstasy, hell, wonder, all through our illegal acts. They have brought us the full richness of the human experience. Our freedom finally, when they understand it at last, is theirs. So keep loving, keep making love, and soon there will be enough. Thank you.” - Kate Millett.</p>
            <p>The event was viewed as a major milestone for the queer rights movement as it showed the presence and power of the queer community. As a man from Topeka Kansas put it “I hope that this will bring to the attention of the entire nation, and particularly our legislatures, that we’re here, and we’re here to stay.”</p>
            <p>Unity was a major focus of the rally as it was the first time that a large group of queer people from across the nation publically gathered. There were group singalongs which included the lyrics “All you gay women, and all you gay men, come together, stand together”. An attendee stated “I think we’re showing our power and our numbers. And I think this will affect our nation’s view of gay and lesbian people, they’ll see that we are a force that has to be contended with.”</p>
            <p>Crowd member from boston “I think this march has brought a lot of people together. In this place, in this time. And I think they should go home and spread the news, and spread the energy that they’ve shared here at home. And start bringing it into the states.”</p>
            <p>Crowd member from Vermont “I think after this march what we’ve got to do is keep organizing in our towns. To keep the local networking together.”</p>
