            <h1>Marsha P. Johnson</h1>

            <p>Johnson was born on August 24, 1945 in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Although assigned male at birth, Johnson enjoyed wearing dresses and other clothes made for women starting when she was only five years old. Eventually due to bullying and being sexually assaulted she stopped wearing women’s clothing. </p>
            <p>She said that her hometown had zero tolerance for queer people and moved to New York City as soon as she graduated high school, with only $15 and a single bag of clothes. She returned to wearing women’s clothes preferring brightly colored, fun outfits, often paired with flower crowns. She also adopted the name Marsha P Johnson. As she put it the P stood for “Pay it no mind”. And Johnson was after a Howard Johnson restaurant she liked. She began describing herself as a gay person, a transvestite, and a drag queen and used she/her pronouns.</p>
            <p>Living as an out trans woman wasn’t easy, even in New York, it was still illegal to dance with a person of the same sex or cross dress. Marsha didn’t have a permanent home during this time, she stayed with friends, at hotels, movie theaters, and restaurants. Due to discrimination Johnson struggled finding work. Eventually she turned to sex work and was often abused by clients. But she was able to perform as a drag queen. Being a drag queen became an important part of her life, in 1992 she said “I was no one, nobody, from Nowheresville until I became a drag queen.”</p>
            <p>In New York she met a younger trans girl named Sylvia Rivera. The two became close and Sylvia said Marsha was “like a mother to her”.</p>
            <p>Johnson’s life became more focused on activism after she arrived at Stonewall Inn at 2 in the morning on June 28, 1969. As police raided the gay bar, making arrests, resistance sprung up. That night kicked off the modern queer liberation movement. Focus is often placed on the white cis gay men who participated in Stonewall but there were also many women, people of color, and trans people present, including Johnson.</p>
            <p>After Stonewall the Gay Liberation Front and the more moderate Gay Activist Alliance formed, they were dedicated to bringing rights to queer people. Johnson was involved with both groups in their beginnings but was frustrated by the exclusion of trans people and queer people of color.</p>
            <p>Together, she and Rivera founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), “an organization dedicated to sheltering young transgender individuals who were shunned by their families.” With this came the STAR House, an accepting, safe place for trans youth to live. They had both experienced housing insecurity at different points in their life so being able to provide a stable home for trans youth was very important to them. At first the STAR House was in the back of an abandoned truck in Greenwich Village. Eventually they were able to move into and try to fix up a building but they got evicted after 8 months.</p>
            <p>In the 70s she became a more recognizable figure in the queer rights movement. She was performing with the popular drag group “Hot Peaches”. Andy Warhol included her in a series of portraits entitled “Ladies and Gentlemen”.</p>
            <p>During this time she experienced mental health breakdowns and was in and out of psychiatric hospitals. In 1990 she was diagnosed with HIV and became an advocate for everyone with HIV/AIDS.</p>
            <p>On July 6th, 1992 her body was found in the Hudson River. Initally the death was ruled a suicide, but violence against the queer community was on the rise and her friends suspected foul play. Police reclassified her death as drowning from an undetermined cause. The LGBTQ+ community was furious that the police didn’t investigate further and that much of the press ignored her death.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of people showed up to the church where her funeral was held, with people pouring out into the street. In 2012 police officially reopened the investigation into her death. In 2019 it was announced that Johnson and Rivera would be the subjects of a monument commissioned by the Public Arts Campaign “She Built NYC.” And in 2020 a waterfront park in Brooklyn was named for her.</p>
            <p>Marsha P Johnson was a powerful advocate for the queer community and gave a voice to many who were wrongly pushed out of the wider gay rights movement. She was and is known for her generosity as she dedicated her life and livelihood to making the world a better place. She wasn’t able to walk downtown without people calling out her name and wishing her well. Her work is carried on today by the Marsha P Johnson Institute which advocates for the rights of black trans people.</p>
