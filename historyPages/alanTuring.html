            <h1>Alan Turing</h1>

            <p>Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London to an upper-middle-class British family. He spent much of his childhood in foster care with his older brother John while his parents were in British India. At 13 he was accepted into a boarding school called Sherborne School. There he studied advanced mathematical and scientific concepts on his own. </p>
            <p>He then secured a spot at King's College. At King’s College he fed his intellectual curiosity and was discovering his sexuality. He graduated with first class honors and was made a fellow of the college in 1935.</p>
            <p>A year into his fellowship he published a paper which became one of the basis of computer science. This paper was about the universal Turing Machine. A Turing Machine is a hypothetical system that can compute anything that is computable and solve any well-defined task when given a set of predefined rules or instructions. Turing Machines laid the foundation for modern computers. </p>
            <p>During World War II he joined the Bletchley Park code breakers at the Government Code and Cypher School. The Germans were using Enigma Machines to encrypt messages in a way thought to be unbreakable. There were over 159 quintillion possibilities of how the messages could be encoded. Under Turing and W.G. Welshman (another Cambridge educated mathematician) decryption efforts were rapidly expanded using a machine called the Bombe which mimicked an Enigma Machine and allowed the number of encryption possibilities to be shrunk to a point where human codebreakers could manually decode messages. Within a few years Bombes were cracking about two Enigma messages per minute. Then the Germans began using an even more complex encryption device called Lorenz. But Turing also developed a method to crack these messages.</p>
            <p>For his work during wartime he was named an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. His contributions are estimated to have saved millions of lives and shortened the war by 2 to 4 years. The intelligence gained from his code breaking methods gave the Allies a leg up and set the stage for victories such as D-Day.</p>
            <p>After the war his academic interests turned to artificial intelligence. He developed the Turing Test to check if a machine had realized intelligence equal to that of a human. In this test a human would ask questions and try to determine if the response came from a machine or human, if they couldn’t determine which ones were the computer the machine would be declared intelligent. These are the foundations of artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>Turing was a gay man. He had attempted to cover this up when he proposed marriage to Joan Clarke, a Bletchley Park cryptanalyst, in 1941. He later withdrew the proposal, explained his sexuality to her, and the two remained friends.</p>
            <p>Ten years later the police were investigating a burglary in his house and he admitted to being in a physical relationship with another man Arnold Murray. This came up as Murray claimed to know the identity of the thief and the police began asking Turing about their relationship.</p>
            <p>In March of 1952 both men plead guilty and were charged with “gross indecency”. Murray was given conditional discharge. Turing did not deny his actions but stated that he hadn’t done anything wrong. Instead of jail time, Turing chose to undergo chemical castration by taking doses of the female hormone estrogen to reduce sex drive.</p>
            <p>Two years later Turing was found dead in his home with cyanide in his system. There was a half eaten apple next to him and the coroner declared his death a suicide. It was assumed that he laced the apple with cyanide and ate it but the apple was never examined. People who studied his psychology and his mother doubted that story and maintained that he accidentally inhaled the cyanide during an experiment.</p>
            <p>In 2013 he was officially pardoned by Queen Elizebeth II and Turing’s Law, which pardoned thousands for their convictions of “gross indecency”, was passed. His legacy continues in the field of computer science as many of his discoveries are still relevant and taught to students around the world. The highest award in computer science, the equivalent to a Nobel in physics or chemistry, bears his name.</p>
