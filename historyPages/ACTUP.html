            <h1>ACT UP</h1>

            <p>In the late 80s and early 90s an AIDs epidemic swept the US, particularly New York. It claimed the lives of 40,000 people in five years, predominantly those of gay men. While AIDs was decimating the queer community many including the government stood by, even referring to gay men with AIDs as “guilty victims”. AIDs was deeply stigmatized, under-researched, and under-reported.</p>
            <p>The first signs of AIDS in the US date back to the 40s and it was in New York in the 60s and 70s. But it wasn’t identified until 1981, when the New York Times ran the July 3rd headline: “41 cases of rare cancer found among homosexuals in San Francisco.” Nationally homosexuality was illegal, you could be fired, denied housing, etc. for being gay. It was thought that AIDS was a biological disease of homosexuality. </p>
            <p>People who got AIDS didn’t get the same kind of care that sick people generally get from family and neighbors, instead they were shunned and often forced to leave their small towns. So organizations like Gay Men's Health Crisis created the Buddy System. Through this system volunteers would be assigned to someone with AIDS and the volunteers would hang out with them and help with tasks like laundry until they died. There were services that delivered food and took dogs for walks. For the first five years the queer community focused its efforts on providing comfort to individuals with AIDS.</p>
            <p>Then in 1986 the Supreme Court issued a ruling that upheld the sodomy law. People were furious. This kicked off the politicization of the movement. Protests began in New York and Washington without permits. Small groups began to form using tactics inspired by the earlier gay liberation movement. The Silence Equals Death Collective formed and made the famous poster with the pink triangle.</p>
            <p>On March 10th, 1987, the writer Larry Kramer gave a talk at the gay and lesbian center in New York. People in the audience wanted to form a group and the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) was formed. They held their first protest on March 24, 1987. 250 protesters disrupted New York morning traffic at the Wall Street and Broadway intersection by laying in the street with signs demanding action. They specifically wanted the release of life-saving drugs by the FDA, the availability of affordable medication, public education around the spread of HIV and policies to end AIDS-related discrimination.</p>
            <p>ACT UP was dedicated solely to ending the AIDS crisis and worked off the principle that people with AIDS were the experts. They acted on many paths all at the same time towards the same goal. And their strategy worked.</p>
            <p>ACT UP achieved remarkable results in a period of just six years. They forced the FDA to shorten the time it took people to receive life saving medication. At the time getting medicine could take years when the people who needed it wouldn’t live that long without it. An ACT UP member and playwright Jim Eigo designed a system that allowed this himself. Then ACT UP organized a massive protest outside the FDA and pushed for the acceptance of this system. They also successfully campaigned for women with AIDS to receive benefits. Originally the diagnostic criteria were based on how symptoms presented in gay male body and women often expressed different symptoms. Any woman today taking HIV pills knows that those pills were tested on women thanks to the work of ACT UP. </p>
            <p>As they continued to stage large, impactful protests that drew media attention the way queer people around the world were perceived began to change. The press began to report on how hard the queer community was fighting for their lives rather than how helpless (and to blame) they were.</p>
