            <h1>Emily Dickinson</h1>

            <p>Emily Dickinson, lived in 1830 in Amherst Massachusetts. She is considered to be the greatest female poet of the 19th century, it’s estimated that she wrote as many as 366 poems. Her poems do offer some insight into her queerness for example:</p>
            <p><i>Her breast is fit for pearls,<br>Bit I was not a “Diver”<br>Her brow is fit for thrones<br>But I have not a crest.<br>Her heart is fit for home<br>I–a Sparrow–build there<br>Sweet of twigs and twine <br>My perennial nest.</i></p>
            <p>However more direct insight into her life is offered through her letters, especially in her letters to Sue Gilbert:</p>
            <p><i>Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me as you used to? Shall I indeed behold you, not “darkly, but face to face” or am I fancying so, and dreaming blessed dreams from which the day will wake me? I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you – that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast – I go to sleep at night, and the first thing I know, I am sitting there wide awake, and clasping my hands tightly, and thinking of next Saturday, and “never a bit” of you. </i></p>
            <p>Initially censored versions of these letters were published by Sue Dickinson’s daughter, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, who seems to have made purposeful admissions to hide Emily’s queerness for example she cut the above letter down to this:</p>
            <p><i>Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday? Shall I indeed behold you, not “darkly, but face to face”– or am I fancying so dreaming blessed dreams from which the day will wake me? I hope for you so much and feel so eager for you–feel I cannot wait. Sometimes I must have Saturday before tomorrow comes.</i></p>
            <p>From that letter it’s clear that Emily cared about Sue but not in the same way we see in the uncensored version. Martha did the same to many other letters, for example a letter from Emily to Sue about Sue’s journal “I want you to get it bound–at my expense–Susie–so when he takes you from me, to live in his new home, I may have some of you.” became “I want you to get it bound at my expense, Susie, so when he takes you to live in his new home I may have some of you.” It’s a small change, but it completely changes the meaning of the line.</p>
            <p>Martha didn’t stop at censoring Emily’s letters before publishing them, she went to great lengths to present Emily and Sue as dear dear friends and nothing more. She insisted that Emily fell in love with a man, referred to Sue as sister Sue, and did her best to portray their relationship as one of sisterly affection.</p>
            <p>Maratha was Sue’s daughter, with Austin Dickinson Emily’s brother. Sue and Emily had been close since childhood and as you can probably imagine their relationship changed nature after Austin married Sue.</p>
            <p>It is evident that Emily tried to steer Austin away from Sue:</p>
            <p><i>…I think it would make Mat very happy to have a letter from you should you find a leisure hour, although she did not tell me to say so…</i></p>
            <p><i>…Mat said she had a beautiful letter from you last night. She was going to send you some flowers in a box, the other day, but you hadn’t then answered her letter, and Mat is very shy, so you see why you did’nt get them.</i></p>
            <p>At the time of the engagement there was a noticeable change in the nature of Emily’s letters to Sue. Emily seemed to position herself as the go between for Sue and Austin while at the same time writing to both of them about how upset she was and with some thinly veiled hostility:</p>
            <p><i>…Sue’s very sober yet, she thinks it’s pretty desolate without old Mr. Brown.</i></p>
            <p><i>She seems to be absent, sometimes, on account of the “old un,” and I think you’re a villainous rascal to entrap a young woman’s “phelinks” in such an awful way.</i></p>
            <p><i>You deserve, let me see; you deserve hot irons, and Chinese Tartary…</i></p>
            <p>She also wrote to Austin, “I took your <i>place</i> Saturday evening, since you have been away, but I will give it back to you as soon as you come home.” </p>
            <p>After this it seems there was a period where there was no communication between Emily and Sue. It wasn’t until 1858 when Emily started writing poetry seriously that communication seemed to be reestablished as Emily sent her poems to Sue for criticism.</p>
